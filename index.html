<!--React is library means it can work in a independent part of your app ie. it can be applied only to a specific section or part of app-->

<!--package.json is the configuration for npm take care abut the pacakages and dependencies
    package.json keep track of the versions installed packeges

npm will take care about the versions of the packages

buldler is a js code

create react app uses webpack 

2 types of dependencies
dev dependency--- generally required in development mode
normal dependency--can be used for production also

npm install -D --- D indicates dev dependency`

^2.8.4
^ symbol indicates that when ther is a minor version change in the pacakage like 2.8.4 then it will automatically update when we keep ^

~2.8.4 
~ indicates that when there is a major version change like 2.8.4 to 3.0.0 it is automatically upgraded

It is safe to use ^ than ~ as major updations may has many changes and it will effect your app


package.lock.json keeps the track of exact version of the package

node modules consists all the code related to the packages installed
Transitive dependency-- A package is dependent on another dependecy ad that dependency depende 
on another dependency in taht way many dependecncies were installed in node modules of we install 
one dependency
collection of dependencies and a data base for all dependencies
